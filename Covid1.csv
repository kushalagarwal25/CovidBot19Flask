testing,How should laboratory personnel remove biohazardous waste from the laboratory or testing area for decontamination and disposal?,"Handle laboratory waste from testing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient specimens as all other biohazardous waste in the laboratory. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that this laboratory waste needs additional packaging or disinfection procedures.For additional information, refer to the following:Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (5th edition)"
testing,How should personnel transport suspected or confirmed SARS CoV-2 specimens within a facility?,"Personnel should adhere to standard procedures associated with other respiratory pathogens, such as seasonal influenza and other human coronaviruses, when they transport specimens within a facility. Personnel should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine if enhanced biosafety precautions are warranted based on situational needs.For additional information, refer to the following:Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)Laboratory biosafety guidance related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).pdfpdf iconexternal icon"
testing,What are Standard Precautions?,"Standard Precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids, secretions, nonintact skin, mucous membranes, and excretions (except sweat) may contain transmissible infectious agents. Standard Precautions include hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, and eye protection.For additional information, refer to the following:2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settingspdf iconpdf iconCDC Isolation Precautions"
general,What are infectious aerosols and droplets?,"Aerosols and dropletscontaining particles that are <100 Î¼m in diameter are not visible to the naked eye. Laboratory workers may not be aware that such particles can be generated during many laboratory procedures and that these particles could be inhaled or could cross-contaminate work surfaces, materials, and equipment.Infectious aerosolsare small liquid or solid particles suspended in the air that contain infectious agents. They can disperse throughout the laboratory and remain infective over time and distance. These particles are of a size that may be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract (<5 Î¼m in diameter). Examples of organisms transmitted by aerosols include spores of Aspergillus spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rubeola virus (measles), and varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox).Dropletstraditionally are defined as larger infectious particles (>5 Î¼m in diameter) that rapidly fall out of the air, contaminating gloves, the immediate work area, and the mucous membranes of the persons performing the procedure.Examples of infectious agents that are transmitted via the droplet route include Bordetella pertussis, influenza viruses, adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus, and Neisseria meningitidis.For additional information, refer to the following:WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, 3rdpdf iconexternal icon2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settingspdf iconpdf iconCDC Isolation Precautions"
testing,At what temperature should specimens be shipped?,"Specimens should be shipped at 2-8oC with ice packs. If the specimen is frozen, ship overnight on dry ice. The primary receptacle and the secondary packaging should maintain their integrity at the temperature of the refrigerant used as well as the temperatures and the pressures which could result if refrigeration were lost. Packages containing dry ice should be designed and constructed so as to prevent the buildup of pressure and to allow the release of gas that could rupture the packaging.For additional information, refer to the following:CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panelexternal iconInterim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"
prevention and protection,Why do you need to wear cloth face coverings?,"In light of new data abouthow COVID-19 spreads, along with evidence of widespread COVID-19 illness in communities across the country, CDC recommends that people wear acloth face coveringto cover their nose and mouth in the community setting. This is to protect people around you if you are infected but do not have symptoms."
prevention and protection,When do you need to wear a cloth face covering?,"A cloth face covering should be worn whenever people are in a community setting, especially in situations where you may be near people. These settings include grocery stores and pharmacies. These face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. Cloth face coverings are especially important to wear in public in areas of widespread COVID-19 illness."
prevention and protection,Do I still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people if wearing a cloth face covering?,"Yes. Wearing cloth face coverings is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19. CDC still recommends that you stay at least 6 feet away from other people (social distancing), frequent hand cleaning and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer, but it may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. View CDCâ€™s guidance onhow to protect yourself."
prevention and protection,What type of cloth face covering should be worn?,Cloth face coverings can be made from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost.
prevention and protection,Who should not wear cloth face coverings?,"Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children younger than 2 years of age, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance."
prevention and protection,Why is CDC recommending cloth face coverings instead of medical grade facemasks?,"Surgical masks and N95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers or other medical first responders, as recommended by CDC guidance."
general,What actions should I take to plan for an outbreak?,"Creating an emergency plan for mass gatherings and large community events, such as concerts and sporting events, can help protect the health of your staff, attendees, and the local community. This planning should include:Encouraging staff and attendees to stay home if sick.Developing flexible refund policies for attendees.Providing supplies for attendees and staff that can be used to help prevent the spread of germs.Consulting local public health officials about your event."
spread,What actions can staff and attendees take to prevent the spread of COVID-19?,"Encourage staff and attendees to takeeveryday preventive actionsto help prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19. This includes:Cleaning your hands often.Avoiding close contactwith people who are sick.Staying home when you are sick.Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces."
prevention and protection,What steps should I take if an attendee or staff person develops symptoms of COVID-19 while at the event?,"If a staff member or attendee becomes sick at your event, separate them from others as soon as possible and until they can go home. Provide them with clean,disposable facemaskspdf iconpdf iconto wear, if available. If not available, provide them with a tissue or some other way to cover their coughs and sneezes. If needed, contact emergency services for those who need emergency care. Public transportation, shared rides, and taxis should be avoided for sick persons. Be sure to contact local public health officials regarding the possible case of COVID-19 at your event and how to communicate with staff and attendees about possible exposure to the virus. Read more aboutpreventing the spread of COVID-19 if someone is sick."
prevention and protection,What is the best way to clean and disinfect the event space after a confirmed case of COVID-19 at my event?,CDC has guidance for cleaning and disinfecting rooms and areas where a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has visited. SeeEnvironmental Cleaning and Disinfection Recommendations.
service,When does CDC recommend that I cancel or postpone an event?,"If there is minimal or moderate spread of COVID-19 in the community, CDC recommends cancelling an:event that includes 250 people or more.3/16/20 UPDATE:During the next 15 days, all U.S. events of 10+ people should be cancelled or held virtually.More Information on Mass GatheringsRead the White House noticepdf iconexternal iconpdf iconexternal iconevent likely to have 10 or more people who are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness. This includes older adults and people with underlying health problems such as lung or heart disease and diabetes.If there is substantial spread of COVID-19 in the community, CDC recommends cancelling events of any size. See page 9 of CDCâ€™s Community Mitigation Framework or definitions of â€œminimal, moderate, and substantial spreadpdf iconpdf icon.â€"
info,What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as thecoronaviruses that commonly circulate among humansand cause mild illness, like the common cold.A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis."
info,"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organizationannouncedan official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, â€˜COâ€™ stands for â€˜corona,â€™ â€˜VIâ€™ for â€˜virus,â€™ and â€˜Dâ€™ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as â€œ2019 novel coronavirusâ€ or â€œ2019-nCoVâ€.There are many typesÂ of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO)best practiceexternal iconexternal iconfor naming of new human infectious diseases."
mental health and fitness,Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about getting the disease from these people. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, toward people who live in certain parts of the world, people who have traveled internationally, people who were in quarantine, or healthcare professionals.Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger toward ordinary people instead of focusing on the disease that is causing the problem."
mental health and fitness,How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional ormental healthof stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. Seeresources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 byknowing the factsand sharing them with others in your community.
info,Why do the number of cases for previous days increase?,"Delays in reporting can cause the number of COVID-19 cases reported on previous days to increase. (Sometimes this effect is described as â€œbackfill.â€) State, local, and territorial health departments report the number of cases that have been confirmed and share these data with CDC. Since it takes time to conduct laboratory testing, cases from a previous day may be added to the daily counts a few days late."
info,What is the source of the virus?,"COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Â Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred withMERS-CoVandSARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of this virus is unknown.More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on theSituation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus."
spread,How does the virus spread?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (â€œcommunity spreadâ€) inmany affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.Learn what is known about thespread of newly emerged coronaviruses."
general,Why are we seeing a rise in cases?,Thenumber of cases of COVID-19being reported in the United States is rising due toincreased laboratory testingand reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
info,Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 isspreading from person-to-person. People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons.How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.Learn more aboutCDCâ€™s guidance on when to release someone from isolationand discharge hospitalized patients with COVID-19. For information on when someone who has been sick with COVID-19 is able to stop home isolation seeInterim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19.Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others."
info,Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period."
info,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?","Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, like a packaging container, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging.Learn what is known about thespread of COVID-19."
info,Can I get sick with COVID-19 if it is on food?,"Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food â€“ additional investigation is needed."
myth,Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,"It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.Â  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
general,What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
myth,What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?,"Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we donâ€™t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please followCDCâ€™s guidance for cleaning and disinfection."
myth,Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?,"At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person. SeeHow Coronavirus Spreadsfor more information."
general,Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?,This is a rapidly evolving situation and therisk assessmentmay change daily. The latest updates are available on CDCâ€™s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
general,How many cases have been reported in the United States?,COVID-19 case counts for the United States are updated regularly online. See thecurrent U.S. case count of COVID-19.
prevention and protection,How can I help protect myself?,"Visit theCOVID-19 Prevention and Treatmentpage to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19."
prevention and protection,What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"There is information forpeople who have had close contactwith a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online."
spread,"Am I at risk for COVID-19 from mail, packages, or products?","There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Learn more aboutsafe handling of deliveries and mail."
general,Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings across the United States, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. CDC is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time."
prevention and protection,Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent COVID-19?,"Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.Contact lens wearers should continue topractice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habitsto help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses.People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.Find more information abouthow coronavirus spreadsandhow to protect yourself.VisitCDCâ€™s contact lens websitefor more information on healthy contact lens wear and care."
cure,Is contact lens disinfecting solution effective against COVID-19?,"Hydrogen peroxide-based systemsfor cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.Always use solutionto disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present.Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.Find more information abouthow coronavirus spreadsandhow to protect yourself.VisitCDCâ€™s contact lens websitefor more information on healthy contact lens wear and care."
"child,women,pet",What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 atPeople who are at higher risk for severe illness."
"child,women,pet",How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects (e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).Launder items, including washable plush toys, as appropriate and in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other peopleâ€™s items.You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 atPrevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirusand atPreventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available atHow COVID-19 Spreads.More information onChildren and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)is available online."
"child,women,pet",Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Itâ€™s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children."
"child,women,pet",Should children wear masks?,"CDC recommends that everyone 2 years and older wear a cloth face covering that covers their nose and mouth when they are out in the community. Cloth face coverings should NOT be put on babies or children younger than 2 because of the danger of suffocation. Children younger than 2 years of age are listed as an exception as well as anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the face covering without assistance.Wearing cloth face coverings is a public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) social distancing, frequent hand cleaning ,and other everyday preventive actions. A cloth face covering is not intended to protect the wearer but may prevent the spread of virus from the wearer to others. This would be especially important if someone is infected but does not have symptoms. Medical face masks and N95 respirators are still reserved for healthcare personnel and other first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance."
"child,women,pet",How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults. CDC offersresourcesto help talk with children about COVID-19."
"child,women,pet",What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?,"This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. However, children do get the virus and become ill. Many schools across the country have announced dismissals for temporary periods. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community."
"child,women,pet","While schools out, can my child hang out with their friends?","The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.Make sure children practiceeveryday preventive behaviors, such as washing their hands often with soap and water. Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.Information aboutCOVID-19 in childrenis somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may have only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, includingolder adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions."
"child,women,pet","While schools out, how can I help my child continue learning?","Stay in touch with your childâ€™s school.Many schools are offering lessons online (virtual learning). Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers.Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know.Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible.Have consistent bedtimes, and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday.Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity.Allow flexibility in the scheduleâ€”itâ€™s okay to adapt based on your day.Consider the needs and adjustment required for your childâ€™s age group.The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school.Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.Look for ways to make learning fun.Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things.Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks.Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact.Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.Use audiobooks or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events."
"child,women,pet","While schools out, will kids have access to meals?",Check with your school on plans to continue meal services during the school dismissal. Many schools are keeping school facilities open to allow families to pick up meals or are providing grab-and-go meals at a central location.
"child,women,pet","While schools out, how can I keep my family healthy?","Watch your child for any signs of illness.If you see any sign of illness consistent withsymptoms of COVID-19, particularly fever, cough, or shortness of breath, call your healthcare provider and keep your child at home and away from others as much as possible. Follow CDCâ€™s guidance on â€œWhat to do if you are sick.â€Watch for signs of stress in your child.Some common changes to watch for include excessive worry or sadness, unhealthy eating or sleeping habits, and difficulty with attention and concentration. For more information, see the â€œFor Parentsâ€ section on CDCâ€™s website,Manage Anxiety and Stress.Take time to talk with your child or teen about the COVID-19 outbreak. Answer questions andshare factsabout COVID-19 in a way that your child or teen can understand.Go to CDCâ€™sHelping Children Cope with EmergenciesorTalking with Children About COVID-19for more information.Teach and reinforceeveryday preventive actions.Parents and caretakers play an important role in teaching children to wash their hands. Explain that hand washing can keep them healthy and stop the virus from spreading to others.Be a good role modelâ€”if you wash your hands often, theyâ€™re more likely to do the same.Makehandwashing a family activity.Help your child stay active.Encourage your child to play outdoorsâ€”itâ€™s great for physical and mental health. Take a walk with your child or go on a bike ride.Use indoor activity breaks (stretch breaks, dance breaks) throughout the day to help your child stay healthy and focused.Help your child stay socially connected.Reach out to friends and family via phone or video chats.Write cards or letters to family members they may not be able to visit.Some schools and non-profits, such as theCollaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learningexternal iconexternal iconandThe Yale Center for Emotional Intelligenceexternal iconexternal icon, have resources for social and emotional learning. Check to see if your school has tips and guidelines to help support social and emotional needs of your child."
"child,women,pet","While schools out, limit time with older adults, including relatives, and people with chronic medical conditions.","Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditionsare at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.If others in your home are at particularlyhigh risk for severe illness from COVID-19, consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people.If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your childrenâ€™s contact with other people.Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail."
"child,women,pet",Is my child with an underlying medical condition or special healthcare need at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?,"Children with complex, chronic medical conditions, including children with physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional differences, can have special healthcare needs. Itâ€™s not known yet whether all of these children are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.Learn more about caring forchildren with special health care needs during a disasterandpeople who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
"child,women,pet",What additional steps should families that have a child with an underlying medical condition or special health care need take?,"In addition to following the recommendations toprevent getting sickandrunning essential errands, families should take extra steps recommended for persons withhigher risk of severe COVID-19 illnessand steps outlined for those withpotential COVID-19 exposure or confirmed illness.Identify potential alternative caregivers, if you or other regular caregivers become sick and are unable to care for your child. If possible, these alternative caregivers would not be athigher risk of severe illness from COVID-19themselves.Try to have at least one month of medication and medical supplies on hand. Some health plans allow for a 90-day supply of prescription medications. Consider discussing this option with your childâ€™s healthcare provider.Review any care plans for your child, such as an asthma action plan, and make sure caregivers and backup caregivers are familiar with these plans.If you do not havecare plans or an emergency notebook, try to make them. They typically include important information about your childâ€™s medical conditions, how to manage those conditions, how to get in touch with your childâ€™s doctors, allergies, information on medications (names, dosages, and administration instructions), preferences (food and other) or special needs, daily routines and activities, friends, and details about routines that are important to support behavioral and emotional health.Learn if your childâ€™s healthcare providers, including doctors and therapists, have new ways to be contacted or new ways of providing appointments. If they offer telemedicine visits, find out how those are arranged and any additional information you need.If your child receives any support care services in the home that need to be continued, make plans for what you will do if those direct care providers get sick, or if persons in your household are sick.Discuss with the support care agencies and the providers ways to minimize risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.If your child or other persons in your household are sick with COVID-19 and are able to recover at home, inform your direct care providers and consider postponing or rescheduling services until the criteria fordiscontinuing home isolationhave been met.Ask service providers if they are experiencing anysymptoms of COVID-19, or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.Tell the service provider to:Wear acloth face coveringif they will be close (less than 6 feet) to you or persons in your household. Their cloth face covering helps protect you if they are infected but do not have symptoms.Ask them to wash their hands with soap and water or, if unavailable, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when they enter your home, before and after helping your child (dressing, bathing/showering, transferring, toileting and/or diapering, feeding), after handling tissues, and after changing linens or doing laundry.Learn more about proper handwashing.Service providers and families should:Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, bedside tables), and equipment such as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, oxygen tanks and tubing, communication boards, and other assistive devices. Refer to CDCâ€™s recommendations forCleaning and Disinfecting Your Home."
"child,women,pet",What can I do if my child has difficulties adjusting to new routines and following recommendations?,"Helping children understand and follow recommendations, like social distancing andwearing cloth face coverings, can be challenging if your child has intellectual disabilities, sensory issues, or other special healthcare needs.Keeping children at home and sheltering in place can lower stress created by social distancing and cloth face covering recommendations. Reach out to others for help in running essential errands.Behavioral techniques can be used to address behavioral challenges and to develop new routines. These include social stories, video modeling, picture schedules, and visual cues. Try rewarding your child in small ways with his or her favorite non-food treat or activities to help switch routines and to follow recommendations.Many of the organizations you turn to for information and support around your childâ€™s complex, chronic medical condition may have information on their websites to help families address issues related to COVID-19.Your childâ€™s therapist(s) and/or teachers may also have resources to help successfully introduce new routines to your child.Additional information oncaring for childrenand onchild development specific conditionsare available."

While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. SeeTesting for COVID-19for more information."
testing,Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the personâ€™s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness."
testing,What kind of test is being used to diagnose if I have COVID-19?,"There are actually many tests being used to diagnose COVID-19 that the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency. All of these diagnostic tests identify the virus in samples from the respiratory system, such as from nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Some tests are conducted at the testing site you visit, and results are available to you within minutes. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once the lab receives your samples.Locations and types of testing sites vary depending on where you live (see question: Where can I get tested). Check with your testing site to learn which test it uses. You can find apatient information sheet about each test on the FDA websiteexternal icon.In the coming weeks, healthcare providers in most states will begin offering home collection kits, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized for use during the current emergency. A healthcare provider will need to give you the approved kit â€“ the Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 test home collection kit. You will be able to collect your sample (a nasal swab) at home and then send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.For more information please seeFDAâ€™s most recent press releaseexternal icon."

"child,women,pet",Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?,"At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Â A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâ€™s always a good idea to practicehealthy habitsaround pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit CDCâ€™sHealthy Pets, Healthy People website."

"child,women,pet",Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, itâ€™s always a good idea to practicehealthy habitsaround pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them."
"child,women,pet",Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"We are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. Until we learn more about this new coronavirus, you should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would with people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, includingPettingSnugglingBeing kissed or lickedSharing food or beddingIf you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering."
"child,women,pet",What animals can get COVID-19?,"We donâ€™t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. CDC is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York has also tested positive for the virus.Recent research shows that ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether animals can spread infection to people.At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19."
"child,women,pet",What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think its COVID-19?,"There is a small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19,do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your petâ€™s treatment and care."
"child,women,pet",What about imported animals or animal products?,"CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States.CDC regulatesanimals and animal products that pose a threat to human health,USDA regulateexternal iconanimals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; andFWS regulatesexternal iconimportation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources."
"child,women,pet",Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets?,"Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States. The first case of a wild animal testing positive for the virus in the United States was a tiger with a respiratory illness at a zoo in New York City. However, this tiger was in a captive zoo environment ,and public health officials believe the tiger became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was infected and spreading the virus.If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we donâ€™t know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife.Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings.Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside.Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close by and will return for their young.Consult your state wildlife agencyâ€™s guidance if you are preparing or consuming legally harvested game meat.Do not approach or touch a sick or dead animal â€“ contact your state wildlife agency instead."
general,Are there work restrictions recommended for HCP with underlying health conditions who may care for COVID-19 patients? ,"Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting HCP and patients in healthcare settings. All HCP who care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients should adhere tostandard and transmission based precautions.To the extent feasible, healthcare facilities could consider prioritizing HCP who are not at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 or who are not pregnant to care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.If staffing shortages make this challenging, facilities could consider restricting HCP at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 or who are pregnant from being present for higher risk procedures (e.g.,aerosol-generating procedures) on COVID-19 patients. Find more information for facilities onmitigating HCP staffing shortages.HCP who are concerned about their individual risk for severe illness from COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions while caring for COVID-19 patients can discuss their concerns with their supervisor or occupational health services.People 65 years and older and people of all ages with seriousunderlying health conditionsâ€” like serious heart conditions, chronic lung disease, and diabetes â€” seem to be at higher risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19.Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited. Pregnant women are not currently considered at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Â However, pregnant women have had a higher risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from the same family as COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza. Find more information onpregnancyand risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
info,Who is at risk for infection with the virus?,"Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected close contact with a patient with symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19 and those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission. For more information, seeRisk Assessment."
info,Who is at risk for severe disease from COVID-19?,"The available data are currently insufficient to clearly identify risk factors for severe clinical outcomes. Based on limited data that are available for COVID-19 patients, and data from related coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV, people who may be at risk for more severe outcomes include older adults and persons who have certainunderlying chronic medical conditions. Those underlying chronic conditions include chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, cardiac disease with complications, diabetes, or immunocompromising conditions.

"child,women,pet",Are pregnant healthcare personnel at increased risk if they care for COVID-19 patients?,"Pregnant healthcare personnel (HCP) should followrisk assessmentandinfection controlguidelines for HCP exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all HCP in healthcare settings. Information on COVID-19 in pregnancy is very limited; facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of pregnant HCP to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, especially during higher risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures) if feasible based on staffing availability."
general,When is someone infectious?,"The onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infections with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (the time from exposure to development of symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) ranges from 2â€“14 days."
spread,Which body fluids can spread infection?,"SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 virus has been isolated in cell culture from the stool of some patients, including a patient with pneumonia 15 days after symptom onset. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer. Duration of several week or longer has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2."
general,Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2?,"The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients with MERS-CoV are unlikely to be re-infected shortly after they recover, but it is not yet known whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19."
testing,How do you test a patient for infection with SARS-CoV-2?,"Clinicians are able to access laboratory testing through state and local public health laboratories, as well as commercial and clinical laboratories across the country. TheAssociation of Public Health Laboratoriesexternal iconprovides a list of states and territories with laboratories that are using COVID-19 diagnostic tests. For more information, seeTesting in U.S.Clinicians should direct testing questions to theirstate health departments. Commercial reference laboratories are also able to offer a larger volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.CDC hasguidancefor who should be tested, but decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and/or individual clinicians.Healthcare providers should report positive Â results to their local/state health department CDC does not directly collect these data directly.See recommendations for prioritization of testing, and instructions for specimen collection atEvaluating and Testing Persons for COVID-19."
testing,"If a patient tests positive for another respiratory virus, should that exclude SARS-CoV-2 as a cause of illness?","Patients can be infected with more than one virus at the same time. Coinfections with other respiratory viruses in people with COVID-19 have been reported. Therefore, identifying infection with one respiratory virus does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 virus infection."
testing,Should chest CT be used for diagnosis of COVID-19?,"Clinicians considering use of chest CT scans for diagnosis or management of COVID-19 patients should consider whether such imaging will change clinical management. The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that CT should not be used to screen for COVID-19, or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19, and that CT should be used sparingly and reserved for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications for CT. Appropriate infection control procedures should be followed before scanning subsequent patients. For more information see,ACR Recommendations for the use of Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) for Suspected COVID-19 Infectionexternal iconexternal icon."
general,Whom should healthcare providers notify if they suspect a patient has COVID-19?,"Healthcare providers should immediately notify infection control personnel at their facility if they suspect COVID-19 in a patient. If a patient tests positive, providers should report that positive result to their local/state health department."
info,How are COVID-19 patients treated?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care for complications, including supplemental oxygen and advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.Corticosteroids arenotroutinely recommended for treatment of viral pneumonia or ARDS, due to the potential for prolonging viral replication, as has been observed with MERS coronavirus and influenza. Corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation or refractory septic shock following theSurviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelinesexternal iconexternal icon).For information on investigational therapies, seeTherapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19."
general,Do patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are admitted to the hospital?,"Not all patients with COVID-19 require hospital admission. Patients whose clinical presentation warrants in-patient clinical management for supportive medical care should be admitted to the hospital under appropriate isolation precautions.Some patients with initial mild clinical presentation may worsen in the second week of illness. The decision to monitor these patients in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend not only on the clinical presentation, but also on the patientâ€™s ability to engage in self-monitoring, the feasibility of safe isolation at home, and the risk of transmission in the patientâ€™s home environment. For more information, seeInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Healthcare SettingandInterim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)."
info,When can patients with confirmed COVID-19 be discharged from the hospital?,"Patients can be discharged from the healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Isolation should be maintained at home if the patient returns home before the time period recommended for discontinuation of hospitalTransmission-Based Precautions.Decisions to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions or in-home isolation can be made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with clinicians, infection prevention and control specialists, and public health authorities based upon multiple factors, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for COVID-19 in respiratory specimens.SeeInterim Considerations for Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19. For non-hospitalized persons, seeInterim Guidance for Implementing Home Care of People Not Requiring Hospitalization for COVID-19, andDiscontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Immunocompromised Persons."
general,How should the use of N95 respirators be prioritized within obstetric healthcare settings during shortages?,"During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care.Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators shouldnotbe used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see:Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies.When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. For more information, please seeInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings."
symptoms,Should intrapartum fever be considered as a possible sign of COVID-19 infection?,"Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient hassigns and symptomscompatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Fever is the most commonly reported sign; most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed feverÂ and/or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (cough, difficulty breathing).Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited; according to current information, presenting signs and symptoms are expected to be similar to those for non-pregnant patients, including the presence of fever.Other considerations that may guide testing are epidemiologic factors such as the occurrence of local community transmission of COVID-19 infections. As part of evaluation, clinicians are strongly encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness and peripartum fever. For more information please see:Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"
"children,women,pets",What guidance is available for labor and delivery HCP with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with COVID-19 infection?,"HCP in labor and delivery healthcare settings should follow the same infection prevention and control recommendations and personal protective equipment recommendations as all other HCP. If HCP are exposed to patients with COVID-19 infection, guidance is available for HCP and healthcare facilities on steps to take. For more information, please see:Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"
cure,Are empiric antibiotics recommended for patients suspected of having COVID-19?,"Several patients with COVID-19 have been reported to present with concurrent community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Decisions to administer antibiotics to COVID-19 patients should be based on the likelihood of bacterial infection (community-acquired or hospital-acquired), illness severity, and antimicrobial stewardship issues. For more information, seeDiagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia: An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of Americaexternal iconexternal icon."

cure,"If my patient experiences an asthma exacerbation, should the exacerbation be treated any differently to reduce risk of COVID-19?","Selection of therapeutic options through guideline-recommended treatment of asthma exacerbations has not been affected by what we currently know about COVID-19.Systemic corticosteroids should be used to treat an asthma exacerbation pernational asthma guidelinesexternal iconand current standards of care, even if it is caused by COVID-19. Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations should be continued. There is currently no evidence to suggest that short-term use of systemic corticosteroids to treat asthma exacerbations increases the risk of developing severe COVID-19, whereas there is an abundance of data to support use of systemic steroids for moderate or severe asthma exacerbations.Patients with asthma but without symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19 should continue any required nebulizer for treatments, as recommended by national professional organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI). If healthcare providers need to be present during nebulizer use among patients who have either symptoms or a diagnosis of COVID-19, useCDCâ€™s recommended precautions when performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs).Clinicians may be concerned that an asthma exacerbation is related to an underlying infection with COVID-19. Clinicians can access laboratory testing for COVID-19 through a network of state and local public health laboratories across the country. Lists ofstates and territories with laboratoriesthat are using COVID-19 diagnostic tests are available. For more information, seeTesting in U.S.Clinicians should direct testing questions to theirstateandlocalexternal iconhealth departments."
testing,Should medical from healthcare facilities treating patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently?,"Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDCâ€™s guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection.More guidance about environmental infection control is available in section 7 of CDCâ€™sInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendationsfor Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings."
prevention,What steps should I take to prepare my facility?,"Because of close contact and the number of people in correctional and detention facilities (including prisons and jails), staff and people who are incarcerated are at greater risk for the spread of germs. To help your facility prepare for the possible spread ofCOVID-19, update your emergency operations plan. This includes:Adding keyCOVID-19 prevention strategiesand posting information in the facility on how to limit the spread of germs.Reminding staff to stay home when sick.Identifying points of contact for local public health agencies.Identifying physical locations (dedicated housing areas and bathrooms) where you can medically isolate incarcerated persons, as well as where to quarantine known close contacts of people with COVID-19.Follow guidance on medicalisolationandquarantine.Medical isolation and quarantine locations should be separate.Offering flu shots to staff and people who are incarcerated, because limiting cases of flu can help speed the identification of people with COVID-19.Developing ways to continue providing critical services, such as mental health support.Ensuring adequate stocks of hygiene, cleaning, and medical supplies.Hygiene: Soap (preferably liquid to promote use), tissues, and hand drying supplies, as well as hand sanitizers, when possible.

prevention,Do I have a greater chance of getting COVID-19?,"Staff and people incarcerated in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for some illnesses, such as COVID-19, because of the close living arrangements inside the facility. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. This is why washing your hands regularly and avoid close contact with other people when possible prevents illness."

Patients should use NSAIDs, and all medications, according to the product labels and advice of their healthcare professional."
prevention,Is it ok for people to visit me?,"Anyone who has had flu-like symptoms in the last 24 hours or has been in contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19 in last 14 days should not visit a correctional or detention facility. All visitors will be screened for symptoms and contact with someone with COVID-19. Staff will also perform temperature checks on all visitors. Visitors should contact the facility about their rules on visits before they travel. If a person in the facility has COVID-19, visitors may not be allowed to enter the facility. Instead, non-contact visits can be used, when possible."
myths and rumours,Do people who are incarcerated have a greater chance of getting COVID-19?,"People in correctional and detention facilities are at greater risk for illnesses, such as COVID-19 because of their close living arrangements with other people. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or be launched into the air and inhaled into someoneâ€™s lungs. It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes; however, this is not the most likely way the virus spreads."
prevention,What to do if someone I know is in quarantine?,"Anyone who has close contact with a person with COVID-19 will need to put into quarantine for at least 14 days. This means that they will be placed in a room separate from others, until staff are sure that they donâ€™t have symptoms. During this time, they will be checked for COVID-19 symptoms twice a day. If testing is available, a person in quarantine may be tested several times until medical staff are sure they do not have the virus."

If there is a person in the facility who has COVID-19, visitors may not be allowed to enter the facility. Some facilities may arrange for non-contact visits when possible."
testing,"If a care facility has a resident suspected or confirmed COVID-19, to whom should this be communicated?","Facilities should follow the reporting requirements of their state or jurisdiction. Those regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (e.g., nursing homes) should also follow allCMS requirementspdf iconexternal icon, which are being updated to include new requirements for reporting to CDC and to residents and their representatives.In addition,CDC recommendsthathealth departmentsbe promptly notified about:Residents or healthcare personnel (HCP) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19,Residents with severe respiratory infection resulting in hospitalization or death, andâ‰¥ 3 residents or HCP with new-onset respiratory symptoms within 72 hours of each other.These could signal an outbreak of COVID-19 or other respiratory disease in the facility. The health department can provide important guidance to assist with case finding and halting transmission.The facility should also have a plan and mechanism to regularly communicate with residents, family members, and HCP, including if cases of COVID-19 are identified in the facility. Often, information in nursing homes is communicated through town hall meetings and staff meetings, along with letters or emails. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person gatherings should not occur. Instead, communication should occur through virtual meetings over phone or web platforms. These should be supplemented with written communications that provide contact information for a staff member who can respond to questions or concerns. Communications should include information describing the current situation, plans for limiting spread within the facility, and recommended actions they can take to protect themselves and others. Facilities should make this information available in a timely manner and offer periodic updates as the situation develops and more information becomes available."
testing,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, are there special considerations for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) in surgical and other procedural care settings?","As part of routine practices, all healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applyingStandard Precautions. HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment at the point of care, safe work practices including administrative controls, Â engineering controls that reduce the production or release of infectious material, and personal protective equipment (PPE) should be applied to the activity according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice.To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:cancel or postpone elective surgery and proceduresconsider nonoperative approaches when feasibleminimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasibleminimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposuresIf surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to allrecommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19.This includes using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.If shortages exist, N95 or higher level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using appropriate engineering controls for source control (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).In the context of COVID-19, some infected individuals might not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms.Depending on testing availability and how rapidly results are available, facilities can consider implementing pre-operative or pre-admission testing for COVID-19. However, limitations of this approach should be considered, including negative results from patients during their incubation period who could become infectious later.If testing is not available or cannot be provided in an actionable time period, facilities could consider using precautions specific to COVID-19 for all patients undergoing evaluation or treatment in a healthcare setting in regions experiencing high incidence of COVID-19 in the community. Data are not available to precisely define the threshold for determining high incidence. If healthcare facilities are unsure about their regionâ€™s incidence, they could consult with their health department. In regions with high community COVID-19 incidence, N95 respirators could be prioritized for the care of all patients who are undergoingÂ procedures that might pose higher risk (e.g., those generating infectious aerosols or involving anatomic regions where viral load might be higher), regardless of COVID-19 testing results."
testing,Do all patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 need to be placed in airborne infection isolation rooms?,No. UpdatedCDCInterim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settingsrecommends placing patients in a regular examination room with the door closed. Airborne infection isolation rooms should be reserved for patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures or for diagnoses such as active tuberculosis.

cure,Should all patients be tested for COVID-19?,"Clinicians should base their decisions on whether a patient should be tested for COVID-19 on:Signs and symptoms,Local epidemiology, andIf the patient has had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or a history of travel from an area with sustained transmission within 14 days of symptom onset.Clinicians should consider that recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.Clinicians are encouraged to test for other causes of respiratory illness in addition to COVID-19. More details on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are found onEvaluating and Reporting Persons Under Investigation."
prevention,Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through drinking water?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19."
myths and rumours,Is the virus that causes COVID-19 found in feces (stool)?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 has been found in the feces of some patients diagnosed with COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19. There has not been any confirmed report of the virus spreading from feces to a person. Scientists also do not know how much risk there is that the virus could be spread from the feces of an infected person to another person. However, they think this risk is low based on data from previous outbreaks of diseases caused by related coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)."
spread,"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 spread through pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas?","There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas. Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water.While there isongoing community spreadof COVID-19 of the virus that causes COVID-19, it is important for individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities to take steps to ensure health and safety:Everyone should follow local and state guidance that may determine when and how recreational water facilities may operate.Individuals should continue toprotect themselves and othersat recreational water venues both in and out of the water â€“ for example, by practicing social distancing and good hand hygiene.In addition to ensuring water safety and quality, owners and operators of community pools, hot tubs, spas, and water play areas should follow theinterim guidance for businesses and employersfor cleaning and disinfecting their community facilities."
info,What are coronaviruses?,"Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause infection in humans and various animals, including birds and mammals such as camels, cats and bats. Some animal coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are communicable from animals to humans. To date, it has been confirmed that seven coronaviruses can also cause infection in humans. When animal coronaviruses evolve, infect humans and spread between humans, this can lead to outbreaks such as MERS-CoV and SARS."
info,Where did the new coronavirus (COVID-19) originate?,"COVID-19 is a new strain of the coronavirus which has not previously been detected in humans. The outbreak started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province.
The outbreak initially appeared to be linked to South China Seafood City. Seafood, chickens, bats, marmots and other wild animals are sold at this market, suggesting that the virus likely originates from an animal source. The virus is human-to-human transmissible and has meanwhile spread to other countries."
symptoms,What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"The symptoms range from mild to severe respiratory disorders with fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. The elderly and people with existing chronic conditions appear to be more vulnerable to serious symptoms. Certain population groups are considered to be more at risk; they are more vulnerable to developing serious symptoms. These are mainly people over 65 years of age and people suffering from serious chronic diseases."
general,"What does a coronavirus (COVID19) infection mean for a healthy person in their twenties, thirties or forties?","The chance that a healthy person in their twenties, thirties or forties will get the coronavirus is just as high as the chance that someone else becomes infected by the virus. Hospital admissions and other complications related to the coronavirus are rare within this age group. However, complications are rare in this age group, which means that few people need to be hospitalised due to the coronavirus."
general,Who is more at risk?,"People over 65 years of age, people with diabetes, people with heart disease, lung or kidney disease and people whose immune system is weakened."
"children,women,pets",Are pregnant women more at risk?,There is no scientific evidence that pregnant women are more vulnerable to this infection or to its consequences. It is reassuring that there are few pregnant women among the very ill. There are also very few serious cases of infection among women of childbearing age. There is no evidence that an infection during pregnancy has a negative effect on the fetus or that the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy
"children,women,pets",Are children more at risk of being infected?,"Children may also become infected with the coronavirus, but they run little risk of becoming very ill. However, they can easily transmit the virus, even if they have no symptoms yet. We therefore advise avoiding contact between children and risk groups, such as their grandparents."
prevention,"I run a higher risk to become severely ill with the coronavirus, what should I do?",Stay home as much as possible. Avoid contact with others outside your family and follow all hygiene measures carefully. It is also better for family members to avoid contacts with other people.
myths and rumours,Am I protected against COVID-19 if I got vaccinated against influenza or pneumococcus this year?,Influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 are two very different viruses. The seasonal influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19. The pneumococcal vaccine does not protect against viral pneumonia.
spread,How does the coronavirus spread?,"The coronavirus spreads from human to human via small droplets that are released when coughing and sneezing. Via these droplets, the virus ends up in the air, on objects and surfaces. Whoever inhales these droplets or gets them through their hands into their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. There is no evidence that the contamination occurs through the skin. The risk of infection is reduced by keeping more than a metre away from sick people, touching oneâ€™s face as little as possible and paying attention to good hand hygiene."
prevention,Does it make sense to wear a face mask for protection against the novel coronavirus?,"Wearing face masks to prevent coronavirus infection, only makes sense in hospitals where patients with the coronavirus are treated and in laboratories where specimens of these patients are tested. It is clear that wearing a face mask â€“ even a so-called comfort mask â€“ will also play an important role in the phase-out strategy.
If you want to know more about the usefulness of a mouth mask, please read:https://www.info-coronavirus.be/en/facemask/"
spread,Is there a risk of infection through contact with objects and surfaces?,"This risk exists, but is much smaller than through direct contact with an infected person.
In ideal conditions, the corona virus survives on average around three hours on smooth surfaces and materials (such as door handles, handrails, tables, etc.). On absorbent materials (such as cardboard, paper, textiles, etc.), the virus cannot survive well. The virus is very sensitive to dehydration, heat and sunlight.
Anyone who ingests virus droplets via contact with hands in their mouth, nose or eyes can become infected with the virus. It is important to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after contact with surfaces and packaging that are touched by many people."
myths and rumours,Will the coronavirus disappear in the spring?,"There is currently no evidence that the coronavirus will slow down or disappear due to spring weather. If we compare with other coronaviruses, it is possible that the new virus will also show a seasonal course, and that spring will slow down the spread due to higher temperatures and UV light. After a few months out of circulation, the virus may come back later. However, it is too early to know the pattern of this virus."
myths and rumours,Can I be contaminated through food?,"To this day, food has not been identified as a probable source or route of transmission of the virus. In addition, coronaviruses are not highly resistant viruses in the environment and are rapidly inactivated when they end up on surfaces. In the current state of knowledge, the likelihood of a consumer becoming contaminated with Covid-19 through food is therefore very low and unproven. Whatever the case, the FASFC reminds professionals that compliance with good hygiene practices is essential and prevents most contaminations:Prepare food separately, especially when handling raw meat,Wash food preparation surfaces, especially those used for raw meat preparations, with soap and hot water,Wash hands with soap and warm water between each handling of food,Cook all raw meat sufficiently (70Â°C through for at least 2 minutes),Avoid preparing food if you are sick."
"children,women,pets",Can pets infect humans if they have been in contact with infected persons?,"The risk of contracting Covid-19 through contact with pets is currently considered negligible, as Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through close contact between humans. Even though Covid-19 is suspected to have originated from wild animals and has since adapted to humans (making it a â€˜humanisedâ€™ virus), until now there is no evidence to suggest that pets pose a risk to humans due to the transmission of Covid-19. That is why we advise you to apply the general rules of hygiene (avoid close contact with your pet, especially if you are sick, wash your hands after touching an animal) if you come into contact with animals that may carry the virus for a brief period of time due to environmental contamination."
symptoms,What symptoms should I look out for?,"If you feel sick, have a cough, a sore throat, breathing difficulties, and have a fever of more than 38 degrees, the coronavirus is one of the viruses you may have contracted. Moreover, if you have recently traveled to one of the countries that have been severely affected by the coronavirus, such as China or Italy, or if you have been in contact with people who have been infected or who have traveled there, you need to be even more vigilant."
prevention and protection,What are the preventive measures against covid?,"Everyone can contribute to the fight against the coronavirus! Some people may be infected with the coronavirus but not show any symptoms, which means they do not know that they can transmit the virus.Anyone can apply the following hygiene measures:Stay at home when you are sick.Very important: wash your hands regularly with soap and water.Sneeze and cough into a paper tissue. Use a new paper tissue every time and dispose of it in a lidded bin.If you have no tissue at hand, cough or sneeze in your elbow.It is safer to keep enough distance in your social interactions to slow down the spread of the virus.Avoid shaking hands or kissing when greeting someone.Watch out for those most at risk: people over 65 years of age, diabetics, people with heart, lung or kidney diseases, children under 6 months of age, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system.-Children do not get seriously ill from the coronavirus, but they can spread it easily. That is why contact between children and older people should be avoided.Avoid contact with people who are visibly ill, or keep your distance."
prevention and protection,Are there specific measures to be taken/observed in care homes?,"his is very important, as the elderly and people with a chronic disease are more at risk to develop a serious form of coronavirus. Therefore, it is important to pay special attention to them.The legislation on care homes is a competence of the regions.

service,Can a company impose shift work on their employees? ,"Companies and employers must organise their activities in compliance with the exceptional legal requirements resulting from the pandemic. A company can therefore implement a shift system to be able to comply with keeping a distance of 1.5 metres.
The COVID-19 pandemic is considered to be an â€˜occurred accidentâ€™ within the meaning of the Labour Code, and the crossing of labour boundaries is permitted. The hours worked in this context fall under the normal overtime regime. There is no special compensation, but the overtime regime applies."
service,And will those employees be compensated for those different working times?,
service,What are the guidelines for companies where a COVID-19 infection has been identified?,"No specific measures are necessary for disinfecting the area. It is enough to thoroughly clean the office/area where the person works and common areas such as kitchen and toilets, with the usual detergents. General hand hygiene must continue to be encouraged among staff."
service,"Is it possible for employ staff  to meet the high demand from consumers (e.g. filling shelves, clearing stocks, disinfecting shops, etc.)?","The COVID-19 pandemic can be regarded as an occurred accident (and to some extent an imminent accident) within the meaning of the Labour Code of 16 March 1971, which allows working time limits to be exceeded in order to perform work to cope with the situation. Night work and Sunday work is also permitted in this case. Work may be performed outside the normal timetables.
Hours worked in the context of an occurred or imminent accident do fall under the normal overtime regime and entitle the holder to overtime hours (more than 9 hours per day or 40 hours per week or lower CLA limit). In the event of hours worked on Sundays and during the night, however, the extra pay stipulated in the sectoral or company CLAs do apply.
Companies and employees must organise their activities according to the measures taken by the government to tackle COVID-19. These measures are a consequence of the pandemic and are therefore an inherent part of the concept of â€œoccurred accidentâ€. The new organisational needs which are directly linked to the enforcement of these measures or which respond to the consequences of these measures are therefore also triggered by an â€œoccurred accidentâ€. Also in such cases, employers will be able to let their employees work overtime as well as outside the normal timetables."

All hospitals in our country know how to treat corona patients in safe conditions. For serious cases, we have two reference hospitals (Sint Pieters Hospital in Brussels and Antwerp University Hospital). If it turns out thereâ€™s not enough capacity, the hospitals may refuse non-urgent patients.

movement,Are visits to prisons allowed?,"All forms of visit have been cancelled to limit the risk of infection of inmates and staff. This means: visits in the visiting room, child visits, unsupervised visits (undisturbed visits, family visits) and visits behind glass.

movement,Can an employee use a digital version of the vignette/employer certificate to cross the border?,"If the employer cannot personally remit the vignette/employerâ€™s certificate to the employee, it must be sent by post.

general,When will this end?,"This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained."
general,How can I help?,"Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)"
prevention and protection,How can I get help?,"This is a fast-moving crisis, and the social, medical and economic fallout is going to affect millions of people for months to come. "
impact of corona,Help me understand the economic fallout.,"Itâ€™s felt a lot like 2008, hasnâ€™t it? Peter S. Goodman, an economics correspondent for The Times, says thereâ€™s a key difference between that economic turmoil and todayâ€™s: the utter unpredictability of the outbreakâ€™s spread. â€œThe disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail,â€ he writes. â€œYet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.â€"
impact of corona,I heard that Americans were getting checks. Whatâ€™s that about?," With the $2 trillion stimulus legislation passed by Congress on March 27, federal lawmakers agreed to provide $1,200 in direct payments to millions of Americans. How much you receive depends on your income. Single adults with Social Security numbers who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full amount of $1,200. Married couples with no children earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. And taxpayers filing as head of household will get the full payment if they earned $112,500 or less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment will be an additional $500."
service,I am a small-business owner. Am I eligible for relief from the government?," The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible."
service,How does unemployment insurance work?," The stimulus plan includes a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would extend jobless insurance by 13 weeks. The program is aimed to help freelancers, part-time workers, furloughed employees and gig workers, such as Uber drivers, as well as full-time employees who have lost their jobs."
service,I am having trouble paying my bills. What can I do?," Student loans The Department of Education has granted a payment waiver of at least 60 days to many people. But itâ€™s not necessarily automatic. In general, you have to call your loan servicer to request a waiver and to make sure that your loan is eligible. The waiver does not apply to private student loans. One big private lender, Sallie Mae, said it is offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrowerâ€™s credit."
service,I dont have health insurance. What can I do?," If you lost your job (and with it your health insurance), or even if you never signed up for a policy, you may have options. Some states and employers have loosened the rules around when you can sign up for insurance because of the pandemic. "
service,Will I be paid if I am told to stay home?,"A coronavirus emergency relief package, passed by Congress in mid-March, gives qualified workers two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill, quarantined or seeking a diagnosis or preventive care for the coronavirus, or if they are caring for sick family members. It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus."
general,How worried should I be about getting sick?,"Everyone should be concerned about contracting the new coronavirus â€” if not for yourself, then to protect others who are at risk of becoming severely ill. As with the flu, the virus is more dangerous for people who are older than 60, people who have a weakened immune system, and people with an underlying condition, like diabetes, asthma or another chronic illness."
symptoms,What are the symptoms of the coronavirus?,"Common symptoms include fever, a dry cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms overlap with those of the flu, making detection difficult, but runny noses and stuffy sinuses are less common. The C.D.C. has also added chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache and a new loss of the sense of taste or smell as symptoms to look out for."
general,How do I take my temperature?,"Taking oneâ€™s temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as â€œnormalâ€ temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. "
prevention and protection,What should I do if I feel sick?,"If youâ€™ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if youâ€™re sick or think youâ€™re sick, but only mildly ill, you should isolate yourself, and you shouldnâ€™t leave your house except to go to the doctor."
prevention and protection,How do I know when it is bad enough to get help?,"With so much advice telling people to stay home, it can be hard to know when emergency treatment is necessary. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said these symptoms should prompt you to seek emergency care."
prevention and protection,What if somebody in my family gets sick?,"If the family member doesnâ€™t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. in February. If thereâ€™s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom to minimize contact with healthy family members. Any shared spaces should have good airflow, such as an open window or an air conditioner, and you shouldnâ€™t allow any visitors except for those who need to be in the house. Your family member should wear a face mask when he or she is around others, and if he or she canâ€™t because of difficulty breathing, you should wear a mask."
testing,How do I get tested?,"If youâ€™re sick and you think youâ€™ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested.  "
cure,Is there a vaccine yet?,"Not yet. But in mid-March, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced  it was beginning the first testing in humans of an experimental vaccine. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, and it was possible because researchers were able to use what they already knew about related coronaviruses that had caused other outbreaks, of SARS and MERS."
cure,Can the hydroxychloroquine drug treat Covid-19?,"There has been a lot of talk about hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but a National Institutes of Health panel has specifically advised against using the combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin outside of clinical trials."
general,"I had the coronavirus, or probably did, and I feel fine now. Can I go about my life?",The latest C.D.C. advice for people with Covid-19 who had symptoms is that they no longer need to self-isolate when:

myth,Are people who get sick (coronavirus) immune from the virus?,"The answer is a qualified yes, but thereâ€™s a lot that isnâ€™t known yet. "
prevention and protection,Should I wear a mask?,"The C.D.C. recommends that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This shift in federal guidance, announced by President Trump at a White House briefing, reflects new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms."
prevention and protection,Are gloves a good way to protect myself?,"Gloves become a second skin. They themselves could become contaminated (donâ€™t touch your face!) and depending on how theyâ€™re made, they might have holes. While gloves may be helpful if someone in your household becomes sick, reducing the amount of times you have to wash your hands, the most effective intervention is just washing your hands."
spread,Is the virus on my clothes or in my hair?,"Probably not. If you are practicing social distancing and making only occasional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, experts agree that itâ€™s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home. You should, however, always wash your hands. "
general,How is it different from the flu?,"The flu and the coronavirus can cause similar symptoms â€” a whole-body malaise, with a fever, a dry cough and a noticeable shortness of breath â€” but there are differences. Because the symptoms are so similar, doctors will sometimes rule out the flu first. "
cure,Is there a natural cure for the coronavirus?,There is no proven cure for the coronavirus. But that has not stopped people (and some businesses) from claiming to have found one.
myth,Will the warmer weather stop the spread?,"Scientists are still looking into this. Some studies suggest that warmer places account for a smaller share of global cases and have had slower infection rates. But none of these findings have been peer-reviewed yet. And even if a certain temperature and humidity diminished the spread, that wouldnâ€™t preclude the virusâ€™ return when the weather cools again."
myth,Can sunlight treat Covid-19?,"No. A new study found that it may potentially slow the spread of the disease, though not enough to wipe out the pathogen or keep the pandemic from resurging in the fall. "
myth,What is this about ingesting disinfectants to treat Covid-19?,"Unequivocally no. Not through drinking it, not through injecting it, not in any way possible. "
mental health and fitness,What can I do to ease my anxiety about this?,"Some of the most important measures you can take to help manage anxiety, experts say, include staying informed on the facts, asking for help and practicing self-compassion. For some people, anxiety manifests in feeling helpless or underreacting to what theyâ€™re experiencing. Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a couple of extra weeksâ€™ supply of food or medication.  "
mental health and fitness,I am having trouble sleeping. Any tips?,"While thereâ€™s no single trick that works for everyone, one thing you can try now to improve your sleep is setting up a consistent schedule. That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed -- that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up. "
mental health and fitness,How can I deal with grief during this time?,"One of the most important things you can do to help manage your grief includes acknowledging it in the first place. â€œThe more we can say to ourselves and the people around us, â€˜Yes, these are meaningful losses,â€™ the more seen and soothed we will feel,â€ Lori Gottlieb, a therapist and author, recently wrote in The Times. "
mental health and fitness,"How can I better take care of myself at home, aside from cleaning?","Having a conversation with everyone in your household, particularly children, about whatâ€™s going on is a good idea to help manage stress and keep everyone at home on the same page. Maintaining your mental fitness, in addition to physical fitness, is also important. Read a book, play a game, call a friend or just otherwise give yourself a break from the news to take care of your emotional and mental health."
mental health and fitness,My eating habits have drastically changed. How can I better manage them?,"Of course, eating too much or too little in the short term is not a huge cause of concern for someone who is healthy, experts said. But in the long term, moderation is important. Your bodyâ€™s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits. "
help,How can I help the health workers?,Many medical workers are coping with an onslaught of sick or anxious patients and inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (P.P.E.).
help,Can I donate blood?,"Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth."
help,Iâ€™ve recovered from Covid-19. How do I donate plasma?,"To qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)"
help,Where can I donate?,"Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. More than 20,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)"
general,Want to give toward medical supplies?,"Relief International, which operates in 16 countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, has focused some of its efforts on helping Iran, where more than 20,000 infections and at least 1,500 deaths have been reported."
general,Want to simply give money?,"GlobalGiving is a large global crowdfunding community that connects nonprofits, donors and companies. It has set a goal of reaching $5 million in donations. Money received will go toward sending emergency medical workers to communities in need, providing medical supplies to hospitals and helping deliver essentials to families."
prevention and protection,Should I make mask at home?,"The C.D.C. recommends that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This shift in federal guidance, announced by President Trump at a White House briefing, reflects new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms."
prevention and protection,Should I make hand sanitizer?,"Until a few months ago, most of us didnâ€™t give hand sanitizer much thought. Now itâ€™s sold out around the world, prompting a variety of do-it-yourself recipes that are designed to be mixed up in a home kitchen."
service,I'm worried about my favorite local business.,Not much can be done to support local businesses due to the restrictions applied by the government.
help,I have older neighbors. How can I help them?,"Older people seem to be particularly susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, according to health officials. Some are staying at home and, as a precaution, may not open their doors to visitors."
prevention and protection,Can I make my home safer?,"So, youâ€™re at home, like millions of other Americans. There are some simple practices there that you can follow to help reduce the risk of being exposed to or spreading the virus. Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and reminding members of your household to do so) and having two weeks worth of meals and any other essentials."
movement,Is it ethical to order delivery in a pandemic?,"Itâ€™s a complicated question, right? Officials are telling us to stay indoors and away from others. At the same time, you need food or, as importantly, medicine. But what about the health of the delivery workers who come to your door? How do we keep each other safe?"
general,How do I make working at home easier?,"Itâ€™s a tough one. The writer Jen A. Miller offers these tips: Keep the same schedule, schedule breaks and proactively stay in touch with others to avoid suffering from isolation. That could mean emailing colleagues more often or holding video conferences to keep in touch. If all else fails, get a dog. At the end of the day, put away your laptop and other work materials so that you can unwind."
general,Should I stock up on groceries?,"No one knows how long many of us will have to work from or stay home, so having food and supplies on hand is essential. Melissa Clark, a cookbook author and food writer for the Times, recently wrote about stocking your pantry."
movement,Can I invite friends over?,"You shouldnâ€™t. As the outbreak has progressed, officials around the world have banned increasingly smaller gatherings: 500 people, to 250, to 50, to 10. In mid-March, Germany banned groups larger than two."
mental health and fitness,How can I exercise if Iâ€™m cooped up all day?,"Gyms are closed, and you canâ€™t get close to people, so contact sports are out of the question. But itâ€™s still possible to get your heart pumping and body moving. "
"child,women,pet",Can I get my pet sick? Can my pet get me sick?,"There is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization and the C.D.C. "
movement,"My state isnâ€™t under any orders to stay at home. So I donâ€™t have to, right?","The situation is changing daily, as it becomes clear the outbreak has spread to more parts of the country. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you arenâ€™t being told to stay at home, itâ€™s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people."
movement,Can I go to the park?,"Yes! Getting exercise outside is a great alternative to going to the gym, where touching high-contact equipment can pose a risk (if your gym is even still open). A study last year found infectious germs on about a third of the surfaces at 16 different fitness facilities. Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, according to the latest research. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea."
service,What's an essential service? Who decides that?,"In places where officials have called for workplaces to be shuttered, there are exemptions for â€œessentialâ€ services and businesses. Those institutions can remain open for customers and have workers onsite."
service,What are my rights for going out for work?,"Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for Covid-19, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employeeâ€™s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus. "
"child,women,pet",My kids are scared. What can I tell them?,"Before you talk to your children, itâ€™s important to understand your own anxiety and keep it in check. If your child is worried about the coronavirus, listen to him or her, rather than respond with comments like, â€œItâ€™ll be fine.â€ Dismissive reactions can make children feel like theyâ€™re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota."
"child,women,pet",My child has mild cold or flu symptoms. Should I take him to the hospital?,"No. Coronavirus symptoms can include fever, dry cough or shortness of breath. If your child has other symptoms, like mild fever, runny nose or sore throat, you should call your pediatrician first before going anywhere. â€œWe want people who are not critically ill to stay out of the hospital,â€ said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at N.Y.U. Langoneâ€™s Hassenfeld Childrenâ€™s Hospital."
"child,women,pet",Should I take my child to her scheduled well visit?,"If you have a newborn, toddler or young child who is still receiving immunizations, it is important to take her to her well visit, as long as you can do it safely, according to guidance released from the American Academy of Pediatrics on March 18. "
"child,women,pet",Should I see my family?,"â€œWeâ€™re really encouraging zero play dates at this point,â€ said Dr. Sean Oâ€™Leary, M.D., an executive member of the American Academy of Pediatricsâ€™ Committee on Infectious Diseases.  "
"child,women,pet",My kids canâ€™t figure out how to play by themselves.,"â€œIn this time of anxiety and uncertainty, itâ€™s really natural for children to regress, which means their dependency needsâ€ â€” for comfort, physical closeness, affection and communication â€” â€œare going to be paramount,â€ said Lawrence J. Cohen, Ph.D., author of â€œPlayful Parenting.â€ "
"child,women,pet",Is all this screen time bad for my kids right now?,"â€œBe gentle with yourself,â€ said Rhonda Moskowitz, founder of Practical Solutions Parent Coaching in Columbus, Ohio. â€œThese are extreme times.â€ "
info,Where does the name coronavirus come from?,"The coronavirus looks like a ball covered with spikes. Its outline is almost like a crown. Thatâ€™s how coronavirus got its name, because â€œcoronaâ€ is Latin for crown."
info,Can you see the coronavirus? Does it have color?,"You need a microscope to see it, and the coronavirus is so small that it doesnâ€™t have color. When you see colored pictures of them, thatâ€™s because scientists have actually added color so you can see the parts of the coronavirus more clearly."
"child,women,pet",My school is closed. When will it reopen?,"It depends. Schools are closed for different lengths of time, and it's unclear when it will be safe to go back. Some schools are trying learning-from-home programs, and others are offering free lunches for pick-up. Ask your parents."
general,Can I have a playdate?,"Probably not. You'd have to stay about six feet away from your friend. Maybe a bike ride or walk, with some distance between you? Or you could try a video-chat if that's an option."
info,Why is it called the coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. In February, the W.H.O. gave official names to both this virus (SARS-CoV-2, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes (Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019). "
spread,How does corona virus spread?,"It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out."
info,What makes this outbreak of covid-19 so different?,"Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions particularly hard â€” not just those with respiratory diseases."
cure,I heard ibuprofen doesnâ€™t work. Is that true?,"The health minister of France, Olivier VÃ©ran, recently left global health officials puzzled when he warned that people ill with the coronavirus should stay away from painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin. He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead."
spread,How long can the virus live on a doorknob? On cash? On my keyboard?,"The coronavirus can live up to 72 hours on some surfaces, like plastic and steel, according to a recent study. It can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours. "

movement,Can I still travel?,"Depending on where you want to go, not easily. In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they began to impose travel restrictions and even close their borders. "
movement,Is it possible to road trip responsibly?,"People around the United States are being told to stay home, but you might still need to make a road trip, whether to care for a loved one or for work. "
movement,My plans got derailed. Can I get a refund?,"With airlines cutting trans-Atlantic flights and cruise lines canceling sailings, travel conditions and refund policies are changing daily."
movement,What about travel insurance?,"Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips only under very specific circumstances. "
general,China seems to be getting back to normal life. How long will that take in the U.S.?,"No one knows. China began taking draconian measures to control the coronavirus in late January, and it was not until almost two months later that it reported no new local infections. South Korea did not lock down cities in the same way, but was extremely fast to test people, trace their contacts and quarantine infected people. And although China and South Korea have demonstrated that, with drastic actions, the virus can be brought under control, there is no guarantee it wonâ€™t resurge as their economies restart. "
general,How is covid-19 going to affect the 2020 election?,"Several states have already postponed their primaries. Officials in states that are going ahead with primaries have been trying to emphasize the new basics of voting hygiene, like using hand sanitizer at polling stations. "
impact of corona,What is the U.S. government doing to help the economy?,"On March 27, Congress passed a $2 trillion rescue package, the largest economic stimulus measure in modern history, to help the people, businesses and industries affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In its sheer scope and size, the aid plan is unprecedented and touches on every facet of American life."
general,What are some of the details of the stimulus package?,"The legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans, including those earning up to $75,000, and an additional $500 per child. It expands jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and extends the payments for the first time to freelancers and gig workers."
general,Is there a country thatâ€™s really handled this pandemic well?,"Governments worldwide have made major mistakes in trying to contain the outbreak. But as the virus spreads, South Korea, Singapore and China have been more effective than others at bringing it under control. South Korea has aggressively monitored infections, such as by checking the body temperatures of all incoming and outgoing passengers at train stations and other places. Officials operate drive-through testing centers and send out mobile phone alerts to citizens when new cases are reported in their districts. Singapore, which has focused on early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing, has also seen its rate of new cases drop."
help,How can I help my older parents?,"Millions of older Americans depend on caregivers, either paid home health aides or unpaid family members, for their day-to-day existence. Both family caregivers and those they care for need to rapidly adapt if they are to remain safe during the crisis."
info,What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Â is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold."
prevention and protection,"Where can I buy hand sanitizer? If I canâ€™t find it in the store, can I make my own?","Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores have run out of hand sanitizers and they may be difficult to find. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued guidance for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the public health emergency posed by COVID-19.Â "
cure,What is convalescent plasma and why is it being investigated to treat COVID-19?,"Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins Â that might help fight the infection. Convalescent plasma is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease and there is some information that suggests it might help some patients recover from COVID-19. Further investigation is still necessary to determine if convalescent plasma might shorten the duration of illness, reduce morbidity, or prevent death associated with COVID-19."
cure,Are chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19?,No. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate and some versions of chloroquine phosphate are FDA-approved to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is also FDA-approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
cure,Are there data showing that chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate might benefit patients with COVID-19?,"In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ€™ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control)."
testing,How are people tested for COVID-19?,"To be tested for COVID-19, a sample is typically collected from your nose and/or throat with a special swab at a designated collection location staffed by health care professionals. Currently, a health care professional swabbing the back of the nasal cavity through the nostril is the preferred choice. Alternatively, the health care professionalÂ may swab the back of your throat, or for patients with symptoms of COVID-19,Â the inside of the front of the nose. Depending on, among other things, the type of swab used, a health care professional may collect the sample, or you may be able to collect the sample yourself at the collection site under the supervision of health care personnel. Testing of the sample is performed in a laboratory on the prescription or order of a health care professional.Â Â "
general,Will there be food shortages?,"There are no nationwide shortages of food, although in some cases the inventory of certain foods at your grocery store might be temporarily low before stores can restock. Food production and manufacturing are widely dispersed throughout the U.S. and there are currently no widespread disruptions reported in the supply chain.Â "
"child,women,pet",Can I get COVID-19 from my pet or other animals?,There is a very small number of animals around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after having contact with a person with COVID-19. There is currently no evidence that animals are a source of COVID-19 infection in the United States.Â 
"child,women,pet","Is there a test for COVID-19 in pets? If so, has it been approved by FDA?","Certain veterinary diagnostic laboratories have developed diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, for use in pets if needed.Â "
"child,women,pet",Should I get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"Routine testing of pets for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time. There is currently no evidence that animals are a source of COVID-19 infection in the United States. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of pets spreading the virus is considered to be low. If your pet is sick, consult your veterinarian.Â "
"child,women,pet",What animal species can get COVID-19?,"We currently donâ€™t fully understand how COVID-19 affects different animal species. We are aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.Â "
"child,women,pet","Since domestic cats can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, should I worry about my cat?","We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. FDA is aware of a very small number of pets, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The majority of these cases were linked to close contact with people who tested positive for COVID-19."
"child,women,pet",Can pets carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets."
"child,women,pet","Is it true that animals, like dogs, cats, and cattle, get their own different types of coronavirus?","Yes. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some coronaviruses like COVID-19 cause cold-like illnesses in people, while others cause illness in certain types of animals, such as cattle, camels, and bats. Some coronaviruses, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals and do not infect humans. For example, bovine coronavirus causes diarrhea in young calves, and pregnant cows are routinely vaccinated to help prevent infection in calves. This vaccine is only licensed for use in cattle for bovine coronavirus and is not licensed to prevent COVID-19 in cattle or other species, including humans."
"child,women,pet", Should I be doing anything different to manage my pets health during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"While you should not avoid necessary visits to your veterinarian due to the COVID-19 outbreak, you should exercise reasonable caution just like you would if you were going to any other public place. If you are concerned about your own health or that of your pet when going to the veterinarian, contact their office in advance to discuss any recommended precautions."
"child,women,pet",Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"Data are limited, but at present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population.
However, due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19."
"child,women,pet",Iâ€™m pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?,"Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. 
Washing your hands frequently,Keeping space between yourselves and others,Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
"
"child,women,pet",Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?,"Testing protocols and eligibility vary depending on where you live.However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care. 

"
"child,women,pet","Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?



","We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk.

 
"
"child,women,pet",What care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"All pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth. This includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and mental health care.

"
"child,women,pet",Can women with COVID-19 breastfeed?,Yes. Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so.
"child,women,pet",Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?,"Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. You should be supported to:
Breastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene; 
Hold your newborn skin-to-skin, and
Share a room with your baby
You should wash your hands before and after touching your baby, and keep all surfaces clean."
general,Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed.

"
cure,Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19?,"Several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19, and the related coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r). These studies were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.

"
cure,Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"Two studies have reported the use of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of these studies suggested that the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection was lower among health workers receiving LPV/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs; the other study found no cases of SARS-CoV infection among 19 people living with HIV hospitalized in the same ward of SARS patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. Again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure.

"
prevention and protection,What studies on treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with antiretrovirals are being planned?,"Several randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of using antiretroviral drugs â€“ mainly LPV/r â€“ for treating COVID-19, in combination with other drugs. Results are expected from mid-2020 onwards.

"
cure,What is WHOâ€™s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?,"Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals for treating COVID-19. Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals and we welcome the results of these investigations.

"
cure,What is WHOâ€™s position on use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19?,"The current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason.[8]

"
mental health and fitness,How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination?,"WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.

"
cure,What is the role multi-month prescriptions and dispensing for antiretrovirals and other medicines?,"Clinically stable adults, children, adolescents and pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as members of key populations (people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people living in prisons and closed settings) can benefit from simplified antiretroviral therapy delivery models which include multi-month prescriptions and dispensing (3-6 month supply) which will reduce the frequency of visits to clinical settings and ensures continuity of treatment during possible disruption of movements during the coronavirus outbreak. "
"child,women,pet",Can pregnant or postpartum women living with HIV transmit the COVID-19 virus to their unborn child or infant?,"There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern."
"child,women,pet",Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?," Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19."
info,How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.

"
info,How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19. 

"
cure,What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection. 

"
prevention and protection,What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread."
movement,What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?,"Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. "
movement,What are the risks arising from public transport to the venue(s)?,The extra risk from participants and spectators travelling on public transport in a major city may not be significant compared to the ongoing risk to the local population using the transport all the time if physical distancing is not possible on public transport.
general,"What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries?","To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest that contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affected countries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.

"
testing,Should blood centers routinely screen blood products for COVID-19 virus?,"No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. "
prevention and protection,Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused?,No. Disposable medical face masks are intended for a single use only.
prevention and protection,Why does WHO recommend contact and droplet precautions and not routine use of airborne precautions for healthcare workers providing care to patients with suspected/confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV.
prevention and protection,Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the covid-19 outbreak?,"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV transmission."
general,Can patients with suspected and confirmed covid-19 infection be cohorted in the same room?,"Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. "
general,Do patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness?,"No. For patients who have mild illness, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. "
general,Are specialized or referral hospitals required for patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 infection when hospitalization is needed?,No. Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients.
prevention and protection,What are the disinfectants recommended for cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients ?,"Environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should use disinfectants that are active against enveloped viruses, such as 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. "
spread,How long can the coronavirus survive on a dry surface?,"There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity, and surface type."
prevention and protection,Is there a special procedure regarding waste produced by patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19?,No. Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious waste.
general,Are there special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from covid-19?,"No, there are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV."
general,Is there a model for setting up an isolation ward and types and products and health requirements?,A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development.
prevention and protection,Can chlorine solutions also be used as hand sanitizer?,Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation.
impact of corona,Will COVID-19 have negative impacts on global food security?,"Both lives and livelihoods are at risk from this pandemic.

The disease is spreading quickly. This is no longer a regional issueâ€”it is a global problem calling for a global response"
impact of corona,"Whose food security and livelihoods are most at risk due to the pandemic?
","Currently, some 820 million people around the world are experiencing chronic hunger â€“ not eating enough caloric energy to live normal lives. Of these, 113 million are coping with acute severe insecurity â€“ hunger so severe that it poses an immediate threat to their lives or livelihoods and renders them reliant on external assistance to survive. These people can ill-afford any potential further disruptions to their livelihoods or access to food that COVID-19 might bring.

"
impact of corona," What are the implications of the COVID-19 situation now and in the future  for food production, agricultural and fishery/aquaculture supply chains and markets?","As of now, disruptions are minimal, as food supply has been adequate, and markets have been stable so far. Global cereal stocks are at comfortable levels and the outlook for wheat and other major staple crops for 2020 is positive.

"
Impact of Corona,How will the pandemic affect food demand?," reduced income and uncertainty make people spend less and result in shrinking demand. Sales declined. So did production. Moreover, the most affected were forced to revert to negative coping strategies - such as selling of productive assets, less diverse diets, overfishing â€“ to compensate for income constraints.

"
Impact Of Corona,How is the pandemic affecting or will affect food prices?,"The international prices of some major food staples, such as palm oil and maize, have in fact declined, so this question is not as simple as it seems. The only staple food that has seen rising prices is rice, and thatâ€™s linked to the export restrictions of a key exporter. "
Impact Of Corona,What is the pandemic's impact on the global economy?,"Markets are more integrated and interlinked, with a Chinese economy that contributes 16 percent to the global gross domestic product. Thus, any shock that affects China now has far greater consequences for the world economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to shrink by over 3 per cent in 2020 â€“ the steepest slowdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

"
spread,What are FAOâ€™s recommendations to mitigate the risks of the pandemic on food security and nutrition?,Countries should meet the immediate food needs of their vulnerable populations.Countries should boost their social protection programmes.Countries should gain efficiencies and try to reduce trade-related costs
general,How has FAO responded to the COVID-19 outbreak?,"As part of its COVID-19 response, FAOâ€™s priorities are: (1) support developing countries to anticipate and mitigate the pandemicâ€™s impacts on their populationsâ€™ food security and livelihoods; (2) contribute to discussions on mitigating COVID-19â€™s impacts on global food trade and markets;"
info,What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

"
info,What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

"
symptoms,What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms."
symptoms,What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms and when should I seek medical care?,"If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.

"
spread,How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus."
symptoms,Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease.Â 
Prevention and protection,How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?,"Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.

"
Prevention and protection,What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.

Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease. In these cases, it is best to stay at home.

"
General,What does it mean to self-isolate?,"Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care providerâ€™s recommendation. "
General,What is social distancing?,"
